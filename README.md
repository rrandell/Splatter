Splatter
========

Its a software bug tracker

This software is a ticket based application.  Submitters can submit a ticket for a certain application and can also track the tickets they submit.  The administrator can assign roles and assign tickets to developers.  Developers can log in and see what tickets have been assigned to them and begin work on the issue.  they can then change the tickets status if issue is fixed.

I would love any and all advice on setup or features.
